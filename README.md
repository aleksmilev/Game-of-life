# Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton where cells in a grid evolve through generations based on a set of simple rules. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state with no further input required.

## Rules of the Game

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (birth).
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive (survival).
3. **Death by Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. **Death by Isolation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (isolation).
